# node-encryption-examples

This repository is a collection of various scripts that illustrate the use of [crypto](http://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html) with nodejs. The aim of this repo is to ease the start with crypto tools and collects a set of examples that enable developers to start quickly.

Currently the collections includes:

 * Encrypt and decrypt text
 * Encrypt and decrypt buffers
 * Encrypt and decrypt streams
 * Use GCM for authenticated encryption
 * SHA 512 generation
 * SHA 512 and streams

 * More details about the crypto examples are described at [Encrypt and decrypt content with Nodejs](http://lollyrock.com/articles/nodejs-encryption/).
